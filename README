This is PiDoorbell version 3.0
==============================
Version 1.0 - Supports photos with Arduino
Version 2.0 - Supports video/audio clip with Arduino
Version 3.0 - Supports GPIO without Arduino - specifically for 2014 tutorial/workshop

Copyright: CodeChix 2013-2014
==============================
PiDoorbell was created by Rupa Dachere in January 2013 and went through
several revisions (v1-3).  This is a live project and is constantly being
updated with new features and bugfixes.

License information
=====================
PiDoorbell license: Apache 2.0

GLIB license: GNU Library General Public License (GNU LGPL)


Whatâ€™s new in this release?
=====================
This is version 3.0 which removes the reliance on the Arduino Uno R3 and 
connects the proximity sensor directly to the RaspberryPi via GPIO.  It
still captures photos as well as video/audio clips.

Possible: Use of the Rpi camera module instead of USB camera


Documentation
=====================

For the tutorial, take a look at the "Docs" dir/folder.

What software you get and what you need to create
--------------------------------------------------

1. What you get
 	
	You will get the PiDoorbell code that runs on the RaspberryPi and
	connects to the proximity sensor and USB camera so that you can take
	photos or video/audio clips.  This includes
		pidoorbell-recognizer.py - main code for detection, notification
		send-notifications.py - code to send tweet, sms etc.
		dropbox-uploader.sh - script to upload photo/video to Dropbox

2. What you will need to create/modify

	(a) In order for notifications to be tweeted/sms'd as well as uploading
		of photos/videos, you will need to create accounts on Twitter, Twilio
		and Dropbox.
		You will need to get your API keys and tokens/secrets from each of these services and modify
		the file called "sms_auth_info.py".  This should be in the same dir/folder as (1).

	(b) You will also need to create a directory to store your video/audio clips to upload
		to Dropbox.  Do:
		"mkdir -p dropbox-pidoorbell; chmod 744 dropbox-pidoorbell"

	(c) You will need to get your Dropbox token and add it as the first and only line
		in the following file.  This should be in the same dir/folder as (1).
		dropbox_token.txt
	 

How to run PiDoorbell from the command line
--------------------------------------------

Assuming you've cloned the repo and have all necessary packages installed (see Dependencies)
and have read & followed the documentation, you should be able to run pidoorbell as follows:

1. python ./pidoorbell-recognizer.py -i 
2. If you want to adjust the latency to account for slow bandwidth when uploading
	to Dropbox, append the latency value to the end of the command like:

   	"python ./pidoorbell-recognizer.py -i <latency_value>"

   	Note that the default latency is 20 seconds.
